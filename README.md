# Model Reduction

This repository focuses on techniques for model mreduction, a process used to reduce the size and computational requirements of machine learning models while maintaining accuracy. 

## Quantization
- Dynamic Quantization
- Post-training quantization
- Quantization-aware training
- Support for various model architectures

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
